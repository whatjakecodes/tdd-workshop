# TDD Workshop

Based on Excalidraw file in `docs/tdd workshop.excalidraw`

## TDD Steps

1. Figure out some initial scenarios to test
2. Figure out what you expect to happen in those scenarios
3. Setup a test file and a test function
4. Setup arrange/act/assert sections in the function
5. Write the assertion (based off expectations from #2)
6. Write the "action" that takes input and returns output
   to assert against
7. Write any setup/arranging code before the action
8. Fix compile errors
9. Run the test -> see failure
10. Write simplest implementation -> run test until success
11. Write next test (or refactor)
